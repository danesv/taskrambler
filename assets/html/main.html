					Welcome to taskrambler, the multi user task organization
					and management tool. If you ever felt working together
					is difficult and I really don't know whats going on at
					the moment this tool might be helpful.
				</p>

				<h2>What is taskrambler</h2>

				<h3>What is it right now.</h3>

				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now this is a HTTP server. It's written from
				scratch in C and serves as the user interface provider for
				taskrambler.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;It delivers static assets placed within the project
				to webbrowsers. In fact the pages you read right now are
				delivered by taskrambler.
				</p>

				<h3>What it will be</h3>

				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is to build a multi user task
				management system inspired by 
				<a
					href="http://taskwarrior.org/"
					target="_blank">
					taskwarrior</a>.
				Users may log in and manage the tasks they have to do.
				Priorize them, assign them to projects, track the time
				spend on a given task and so on.
				Users also can configure who would be able to see what
				task and users with special roles, like managers will
				be able to see all tasks of their team, etc.
				It will be possible to create reports about what work was
				done etc.
				</p>

				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally this will serve as a ticket system.
				Tasks may be assigned to users and all the things
				possible with a ticket system will be possible here too.
				So this will combine a personal task management tool with a
				ticket system. Thus providing a getting things done tool
				that will improve the productivity of all persons working
				on a project.
				</p>

				<h2>What is it not</h2>

				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not another web server and it is not a
				web application as you might be used to. It will not run
				under any given web server. It brings it's own web server.
				</p>

				<h2>History</h2>
				
				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;About two year ago I stepped across the
				<a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem"
					target="_blank">
					C10k</a>
				problem. At that time, and in fact still right now, I don't
				feel experienced enough to face this problem. But anyway, 
				it made me curious. Curious if I would be able to write an
				HTTP server by my own. So I started work on this.
				</p>

				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there are enough web servers available
				right now, even the C10k problem has brought up some really
				interesting exemplars. So I decided not to build another
				multi purpose HTTP server application but try another thing.
				I wanted to build an application with a user interface
				provided via browser. But what kind of application.
				</p>

				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time I started this I was working for
				bigpoint, which is one of the worlds biggest browser
				game providers. So the first answer was obviously to build
				a game. But soon I realized that it needs much to build
				a game from scratch. You need a fascinating storyboard,
				well ballancing and game design and so on. So I dropped this
				idea again.
				</p>

				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately at the same time I started working
				with
				<a
					href="http://taskwarrior.org/"
					target="_blank">
					taskwarrior</a> which I found a really useful tool.
				I thought what about making something like this but for
				multiple users. It is pretty clear to you what you need for
				this and it would be cool to have something like this...
				and with some luck there are others who might be interested in
				such a thing too.
				</p>

				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;From the first day on the idea was to build
				this completely in C. This primary decision for this was
				that I really like the language and it had been a very long
				time since I last had the opportunity to do something in that
				language. Maybe another reason was that I had the hope to
				compete with some of the other C10k webservers. And well,
				taskrambler does not perform to bad at all. I did not
				choose C++ also I like some of the object oriented
				concepts because as most other OOP languages I think of
				it as bloated with stuff I never need. Please don"t flame
				on this, its only my opinion.
				</p>

				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three things I really like in OOP,
				objects and their definition via classes, interfaces
				and inheritance. Why? Because if you ask me the whole topic
				is about reusability and maintanability.
				Obviously a well designed class is reusable. What makes
				it well defined? It implements an interface an reacts in
				a sane way on it. Well and inheritance is "sometimes" a good
				way to prevent duplicate code.
				</p>

				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time ago I had read a book called
				<a
					href="https://ritdml.rit.edu/handle/1850/8544"
					target="_blank">
				Object oriented programming with ANSI-C</a> from 
				Axel-Tobias Schreiner. It has some really interesting
				concepts in it but goes a step to for for my taste with
				creating an own code preprocessor and other things. Anyway
				this was the base of a class like code framework which
				consists mostly of preprocessor code and some C code lines,
				as well as a code convention.
				This gives me the possibility to implement a well defined
				interface on various objects. I can extend and inject
				classes. All objects have a constructor and a destructor and
				if needed a clone constructor.
				Finishing this was the first building block of taskrambler.
				</p>

				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;The next goal was a working HTTP server
				implementation. I created a lot of classes, rewrote then
				dropped them again and thought about other solutions.
				At a given point I was really disappointed because on heave
				load the servers droped connection and I was unable to
				find out why. At that point I stopped working on this for
				over a year. But now I started again added some new cool
				code and think that the connection wasn"t been dropped by
				taskrambler but by the kernel. Shortly before I loose
				connection I found a kernel log entry that says that
				syn flood protection was been activated.
				</p>

				<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now this is an HTTP server that is able
				to handle cookies, speeks SSL and implements the subset
				of the HTTP protocol that I need. It performs not to bad
				but others should mesure this, I have no time for this.
				I know a lot of places where optimization is still possible.
