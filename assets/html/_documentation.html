<h2>API Doc and test coverage</h2>

<p>
	There is the beginning of a api doc and automated
	test coverage reports.<br />
	Both don't cover the complete code.<br />

	There is the beginning of a generated API doc
	<a href="/doc/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />

	I also started automated regression tests. The
	results can be seen 
	<a href="/coverage/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Version 0.1.5</h2>

<p>
Another step on the way. Now basic signup is possible.
Users and credential will be stored in gdbm files.
If you do not want to signup you can use the pre created
guest account to login.<br/><br/>
<b>username:</b> guest<br/>
<b>password:</b> guest<br/><br/>
This user will not be available if you build your own
version of taskrambler.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
The signup and login can be testes by clicking on
signup or login in the menu. A popup should occur where
you can enter the neccessary informations. Currently
no sanity checks are done on the given data. The key
is the email address.
</p>

<p>
If you signup with an email address
that is already in the database nothing happens, else
a user will be created and logged in.
</p>

<p>
After a successful login the first and surname will be
visible in the upper right corner of the page.
</p>

<p>
Additionally to the name you can find the version,
session id as well as an indicator how long the session
lasts. A session lasts 5 minutes since the last preocessed
request.
