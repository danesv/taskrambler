<h2>API Doc and test coverage</h2>

<p>
	There is the beginning of a api doc and automated
	test coverage reports.<br />
	Both don't cover the complete code.<br />

	There is the beginning of a generated API doc
	<a href="/doc/v0.1.6/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />

	I also started automated regression tests. The
	results can be seen 
	<a href="/coverage/v0.1.6/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2>Version 0.1.6</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Bugfixes and optmizations in the server main loop.</li>
	<li>Load parts of the UI via ajax calls thus preventing code
	repitition in there.</li>
	<li>Add m4 macros to build with dragonegg. I also tried to build
	with clang and it works without any change for me.</li>
	<li>Fix build system. Now it is again possible to build actual
	coverage reports and API docs.</li>
	<li>Fix memory handling when optimizations are not in place.</li>
	<li>Optimize session handling. The way I did it before reduced the
	overall server performance. Apache Bench made only about
	200 to 400 requests per second. Now it is again up at around 13000
	requests per second on my core2 development machine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.1.5</h2>

<p>
Another step on the way. Now basic signup is possible.
Users and credential will be stored in gdbm files.
If you do not want to signup you can use the pre created
guest account to login.<br/><br/>
<b>username:</b> guest<br/>
<b>password:</b> guest<br/><br/>
This user will not be available if you build your own
version of taskrambler.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
The signup and login can be testes by clicking on
signup or login in the menu. A popup should occur where
you can enter the neccessary informations. Currently
no sanity checks are done on the given data. The key
is the email address.
</p>

<p>
If you signup with an email address
that is already in the database nothing happens, else
a user will be created and logged in.
</p>

<p>
After a successful login the first and surname will be
visible in the upper right corner of the page.
</p>

<p>
Additionally to the name you can find the version,
session id as well as an indicator how long the session
lasts. A session lasts 5 minutes since the last preocessed
request.
