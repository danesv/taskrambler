I am about to make a new release 0.1.8 of this. It took a long time since
the last release. Originally this was ment to implement some kind of RBAC
but now it improves user management to have resources (users) where
RBAC could be used on.

So, in this version you got improved user management and an improved UI.

I have new hardware and with this I got really impressive result from
ApacheBench. I can handle the simple /version/ request about 40000 times
a second on a new Core I5. This is more than double of the result on my
old Core2Duo, and we are still single threaded.
