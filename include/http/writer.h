/*
 * the buffer that will be written back to an http client.
 * If we have open 1024 paralell connection this will result
 * in a memory usage of 128MB. Right now, we don't allow more
 * than this amount of paralell connections.
 * 
 * This one and the parser buffer are the hugest memory pools
 * we need. The parser buffer is of the same size.
 *
 * Right now only the ringbuffer is reused for each connection
 * resulting in some memory movement between some temporary
 * space and the circular buffer.
 *
 * This behavioru should be kept in place for low memory machines
 * running this code.
 *
 * Anyway, I will build a version which uses two ringbuffers for
 * each connection, Resulting in a 256KB memory used for each
 * connection. Which in turn means 256MB for 1024 paralell connections.
 *
 * And as I will also implement a cbuf pool, this memory will not be
 * freed before application end.
