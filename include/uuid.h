/**

 * ways to create uuid variant 5. For uuid of variant 1 I use
 * the implementation delivered with the core utils.
 * But this is wrapped in here, so that the rest of the code
 * can use only this implementation...this additionally has the
 * advantage that we can implement version 1 here too for systems
 * where the coreutils implementation is not available.
