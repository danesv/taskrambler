/**
 * \file
 * A generic REST router that is able to map a URL to a specific
 * function. It uses dlsym to get the address of the function to
 * be called.
 * The functions need to have a common interface for sure....This will
 * work out while I am working on this.
 * After a function is found it's address will be stored in a hash
 * so that further lookups might be faster.
 * By it's nature I think this is part of the HttpApplicationAdapter.
