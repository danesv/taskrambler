 * Container for authentication modules.
 *
 * This is a single point of authentication no matter how much
 * authentication modules are in place. Thus it prevents adding
 * more and more authentication modules to the application.
 * This is an auth module itself but this one returns 0 if
 * the authentication has failed otherwise the id of the
 * successfull auth module. Thus we can identify by what method
 * the user has been authenticated.
 *
 * This can't authenticate by its own. It has to be initialized
 * with other auth modules by calling authCreate at least once.
 *
 * origin intend ... never implemented (but maybe a good idea)
 *
 * Authenticatio module factory
 *
 * A factory to get a specific authentication module.
 * An authentication module is a class that implement the Auth interface.
