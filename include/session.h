/**
 * Having only a session livetime is not enough.
 * An attacker might create a client that never sends a session id
 * back and continuously sends requests. This will then result
 * in newly created sessions.
 * The session class uses 57 bytes
 * But there is also a user object created all the time.
 * This uses 80 bytes.
 * Each user in turn contains a uuid which is 37 bytes.
 * Each of these are a class which adds another 221 bytes to each.
 * So the following is allocated for these three objects:
 * Session: 57 + 221 = 278
 * User:    80 + 221 = 301
 * Uuid:    37 + 221 = 258
 * My allocater only allocates power of 2 sizes to optimize
 * memory management so we end up with 512 bytes per object which is
 * 1536 bytes per created session.
 * The current code is able to handle more than 25000 request per 
 * second if there is no session id provided on my hardware.
 * This sums up to 10GB of used memory within the 5 minutes
 * session livetime.
 *
 * To prevent this I associate the session with the ip it was
 * created on. If there then is a subsequent request from the same ip
 * without a sessionid, the old session can be removed and a new one
 * can be created. This might give a small but acceptable performance
 * hit.
