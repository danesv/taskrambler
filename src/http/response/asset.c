/**
 * \file
 * A response class that delivers an asset (file on disk).
 *
 * In future this will use a asset class, get from an asset class
 * hash. The asset hash will be a shared resource between all
 * workers.
 *
 * The asset class holds an open file descriptor wich is memory
 * mapped and is able to give the correct pointer to neede data.
 *
 * This change will envolve changes in other parts of the response
 * write system, as we no longer need to destinguish between piped
 * and bufferd resources...we will allways work with a memory address
 * only one time its allocated and one time a memory mapped file.
