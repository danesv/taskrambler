	 * sessions....
	 *
	 * @TODO
	 * Build a way to cleanup the hash by a filter...currently 
	 * there is nothing I could use for this.
	 * Well this is practically impossible in reasonable time
	 * because every time I remove one element the tree has to 
	 * be rebalanced....
	 * 
	 * I have to store all nodes in a different structure that
	 * gives me the possibility to find fast expired objects.
	 * These can then be removed from both structures....
	 *
	 * Anyway this is the pure horror...because I have to compute
	 * the condition for every stored session....and I really have to
	 * do this...else the tree would grow and grow all the time...
	 * 
	 * I think the best I can do at this point is, at least for the moment,
	 * to store the sessions in a list and not in a stack.
	 * Each request will than have to walk through that list, 
	 * remove expired sessions and pick out its own....
	 * this is O(n), but currently I gave no better idea at all.
