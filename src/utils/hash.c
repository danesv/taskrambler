/**
 * SDBM hashing algorithm:
 *
 * this algorithm was created for sdbm (a public-domain reimplementation of
 * ndbm) database library. it was found to do well in scrambling bits,
 * causing better distribution of the keys and fewer splits. it also happens
 * to be a good general hashing function with good distribution. the actual
 * function is hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 65599 + str[i]; what is included below
 * is the faster version used in gawk. [there is even a faster, duff-device
 * version] the magic constant 65599 was picked out of thin air while
 * experimenting with different constants, and turns out to be a prime. this
 * is one of the algorithms used in berkeley db (see sleepycat) and elsewhere.
