/**
 * \file This holds all stufff related our memory managent.
 * I try the best as far as I can to reduce memory fragmentation
 * and unneccessary calls to alloc and free.
 *
 * To achive this I try an approach described here as "Quick Fit".
 * http://www.flounder.com/memory_allocation.htm
 *
 * The basic idea is to keep allocated memory segments and don't free
 * them again. Instead I will put them in a tree indexed by their size.
 * To get new memory I first have a look in the tree if there is
 * a fitting memory segment. Fitting mean, larger or exactly the size
 * I need. If there is one, use it. If not create a new one using 
 * usual malloc approach.
 * I won't split the reagions at all because most likely they will be
 * free soon again. This way I might waste some memory, so I have to
 * keep an eye on this.
 *
 * Right now I don't build an upper limit for allocation. The limit
 * still is the system memory itself.
 *
 * This is not implemented as a class because it will be used in the 
 * process of object creation.
