FOR VERSION 0.2

- abstract application logic from server logic. The HTTP processors should
  only care about HTTP, no application stuff at all. The idea is to create
  a class for application commands and one for applications answers.
  Additionally an adapter has to be created to translate application
  messages from and to HTTP messages.
  The advantage is that the application logic will be totally separated from 
  the communication layer. This way other communication protocols could be
  added when need is there.

- move authentication from communication layer to application layer.

- add a first simple session persistence stuff.
  This could store informations like the username and the last login
  date and present these to the user.

- Let a user being able to create tasks and get them again after login.

- Implement roles and role based access model.

- Create management for roles.

- Give a user the ability to open tasks to other users / roles....

- right now i will use long polling ajax calls when feedback from to the client
  is needed. In the long term this should be changed to websockets (ws). But
  right now ws specification is not final anyway. :) (optional)

- IPV6 support (optional)
