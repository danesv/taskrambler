VERY BIG TODO:
- right now i will use long polling ajax calls when feedback from to the client
  is needed. In the long term this should be changed to websockets (ws). But
  right now ws specification is not final anyway. :)

- handle errors after all system call...especially open, close, etc.

- IPV6 support

- There seem to be a problem in the server under heavy load. Some tests with ab show that at some point it does not accept any more connections. Nor does it seem to answer request. I guess that it might be difficult to find this....
  => might be done...
