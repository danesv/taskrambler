VERY BIG TODO:
- right now i will use long polling ajax calls when feedback from to the client
  is needed. In the long term this should be changed to websockets (ws). But
  right now ws specification is not final anyway. :)

- handle errors after all system call...especially open, close, etc.

- IPV6 support
