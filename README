Actually this is some kind of server toolkit, also containing
a class and interface toolkit for C.
I use a gcc preprocessor extension to use empty variadoc
argument lists so actually this is gcc only code.

This should become a server that has a dynamic time-sliced part
that updates an internal state all the time.
Clients might connect as they want and get some information
from the server.
The server should scale in two manners.
New instances should be able to handle connection and get
updates about the computed state.
Additionally new instances might hold their own state which
all other instances might update.

In a first run the state might be something simple as a 
matrix where every field hold a unique value. e.g.

 -------------
 |1|4|a|j|k|9|
 -------------
 |1|4|a|j|k|9|
 -------------
 |1|4|a|j|k|9|
 -------------
 |1|4|a|j|k|9|
 -------------

suggestion for timing: sigsuspend
